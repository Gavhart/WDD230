          Kenai City History</H4>
        <p>
          Kenai is a city in the Kenai Peninsula Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. The population was 7,100 as of the
          2010 census, up from 6,942 in 2000.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city of Kenai is named after the local Dena'ina (Tanaina) word 'ken' or 'kena', which means 'flat, meadow,
          open area with few trees; base, low ridge', according to the Dena'ina Topical Dictionary by James Kari, Ph.D.,
          published in 2007. This describes the area along the mouth and portion of the Kenai River near the City of
          Kenai. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area was first occupied by the Kachemak people from 1000 B.C.,
          until they were displaced by the Dena'ina Athabaskan people around 1000 A.D. Before the arrival of the
          Russians, Kenai was a Dena'ina village called Shk'ituk't, meaning 'where we slide down.' When Russian fur
          traders first arrived in 1741, about 1,000 Dena'ina lived in the village. The traders called the people
          'Kenaitze', which is a Russian term for 'people of the flats', or 'Kenai people'. This name was later adopted
          when they were incorporated as the Kenaitze Indian Tribe in the early 1970s.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1786 Pytor Zaikov built Fort Nikolaevskaia for the Lebedev-Lastochkin Company on the site of modern Kenai,
          being the first European settlement on the Alaskan mainland. Hostilities surfaced between the natives and
          settlers in 1797, culminating in an incident in which the Dena'ina attacked Fort St. Nicholas, later dubbed
          the battle of Kenai. Over one hundred deaths occurred from all involved parties. Later, in 1838, the
          introduction of smallpox killed one half of the Dena'ina population.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1869, after the Alaska Purchase, the United States Army established a post called Fort Kenay. It was soon
          abandoned.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1888 a prospector named Alexander King discovered gold on the Kenai Peninsula. The amount of gold was small
          compared to the later gold finds in the Klondike, Nome and Fairbanks. In 1895-96, the Holy Assumption of the
          Virgin Mary Russian Orthodox Church was built in the village. It is still in use today. The establishment of
          shipping companies in the early 1900s broadened Kenai into a port city. Canning companies were established
          and helped fuel the commercial fishing boom that was the primary activity through the 1920s.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1911, construction began on the Kenai Railroad (now Alaska Railroad) connecting Kenai to the coal fields
          of the upper Cook Inlet. The project stalled for years from lack of funding until President Woodrow Wilson
          authorized completion of the railroad in 1915. The first scheduled train from Seward arrived in Kenai on July
          1, 1915, carrying 300 passengers, 117 mules, and 10 cars of freight and mail. In 1916, the U.S. Navy
          established a radio station in Kenai to maintain communications with the rest of the world. A post office was
          established in 1922 and the city incorporated in 1960.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oil was discovered in nearby Swanson River in 1957, bringing some economic development to the area. In 1965,
          offshore oil discoveries in Cook Inlet caused a period of rapid growth. Many citizens of the City of Kenai
          work for and depend on the oil industry. The construction of offshore oil platforms in Cook Inlet had a
          "ripple effect" and a number of support industries sprang up in Kenai. Oil and gas exploration are still
          important parts of the local economy. Kenai has a municipal airport with a 7,000-foot (2,100 m) long paved
          runway (airport code ENA), a number of paved and gravel roads, and offer a variety of services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kenai and the neighboring city of Soldotna cooperate to provide housing and support infrastructure for
          workers and families employed in the oil industry on the Kenai Peninsula. There are several state and
          private-owned facilities for lodging and meals in the Kenai-Soldotna area. Kenai has a public school system
          with grades pre-K-12. The Kenai Peninsula Borough School District is the largest school district in the state
          and the Kenai Peninsula Borough is the largest borough in the United States. Kenai has three public schools:
          Mt. View Elementary, Kenai Middle School, and Kenai Central High School. There are also two private schools
          located in Kenai: Aurora Borealis Charter School and Grace Lutheran School.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kenai has a climate that is strongly influenced by the Cook Inlet and the neighboring Kenai Mountains. The
          climate is characterized by long, cold winters and short, mild summers. Kenai has a wide variation between
          temperatures during summer and winter. The average high temperature during July is usually about 65 Â°F (18
          Â°C) but often rises to 80 Â°F (27 Â°C) or more. The average high temperature during January is about 25 Â°F (âˆ’4
          Â°C). Snowfall averages 63 inches (160 cm) per year, with the heaviest snowfalls occurring during the months
          of October through March. Kenai has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 101 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kenai is located at 60Â°33â€²31â€³N 151Â°13â€²47â€³Wï»¿ / ï»¿60.55861Â°N 151.22972Â°Wï»¿ / 60.55861; -151.22972 (60.558738,
          -151.229616). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 35.5 square miles
          (92 km2), of which, 29.9 square miles (77 km2) of it is land and 5.6 square miles (15 km2) of it (15.84%) is
          water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kenai has a subarctic climate (KÃ¶ppen Dfc) with mild winters compared to the interior, due to the close
          proximity to the ocean. The highest temperature ever recorded at Kenai was 96 Â°F (36 Â°C) on July 14, 1975,
          tied with Anchorage on the same day. The lowest temperature ever recorded was âˆ’48 Â°F (âˆ’44 Â°C) on February 4,
          1947. Average annual precipitation is 16.85 inches (428 mm). Snowfall averages 63 inches (160 cm) per year,
          with the heaviest snowfalls occurring during the months of October through March. Kenai has a frost-free
          growing season that averages slightly over 101 days.
